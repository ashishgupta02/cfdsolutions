Guidelines to coding practices followed in this project
/*******************************************************/
PRINCIPLE OF THOUGHT: 
It is more important to have something that works than nothing at all.

0. Please insert the GNU GPL copyright notice in every source code file you 
check in.

1. All coding is currently being done in C, for pure love.
The aim is to support more than just GNU gcc as a compiler and more operating
systems, hence we stick to a standard C writing style, preferable K&R C or ANSI C.

2. Platform specific code - All platform specific #ifdef's and header file includes
should be in "platform.h". Unless inevitable, it would be a good practice to
not use a lot of #ifdef's for different platforms in the main code to avoid
clutter.

3.Writing  comments: 
a) Permanent comments in the source code should begin with "/*" 
and should end with obviously "*/". Every new line should begin with
a "*" sign. For example, look at airfoil_internal.h. Use a good editor and it
should be easy to do.

b) Temporary comments in the souce code can begin with "//". The difference
between this and the above is that some proprietary C compilers do not support "//"
as this is a C++ syntax.

c) Tags - Preferable tags are FIXME and TODO as editors like vi and emacs highlight them
for the user to notice. These tags should be used in the comments if some bug or 
some inefficient method is used "for now" and will need to be optimized later for better
performance, or also when a certain feature needs to be added.

4. Header files:  The following order should be followed while writing a
header file.
a) A  #ifndef statement check for whether the header file
has been included or not.
b) Any other header files that will be included should be placed here.
c) All macro definitions should come here.
d) All variable and structure declarations should come here.
e) All function declarations should come here with /*comments*/ explaining
what the function does.
f) A #endif statement followed by the constant it is ending in comments. 
For example, look at airfoil_internal.h and errlog.h 
Preferably, structure declarations and function declarations should be in
separate files for cleanliness.
